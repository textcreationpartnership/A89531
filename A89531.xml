            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                        <head>CHAP. I. What things are to be taken heed of in the two firſt Moneths.</head>
                        <p>SO ſoon as the woman ſhall begin to be with child, which ſhe ſhall eaſily know, by ſtopping of her monethly flux,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:170973:7"/> without diſeaſe, or ancientneſſe of yeares; ſhe ſhall abſtain from all vehement motions and excrciſe, whether ſhe walk on foot, or ride on horſeback, or in a Coach, or be carried in a Horſe-litter; For where the body is too much ſtirred, the internall membrane of the Womb is either accuſtomed to be broken, or to be looſly reſolved, and thereupon abort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment preſently followeth.</p>
                        <p>To theſe things the woman with child muſt diligently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, that ſhe lift not her armes up too high, nor carry great burthens, nor repoſe her ſelf on hard and uneaſie ſeats: But inſtead of exerciſe, which may alwayes in ſome precede be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore meat, ſhe may walk on foot gently, or ſuffer her body and armes gently to be rubbed and ſtroked, or may ſtretch them forth with ſpinning or carding.</p>
                        <p>Let her moderately uſe meat of good juyce and eaſie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, and Wine not too ſtrong and too ſharp, but a little mingled with water, or if ſhe be abſtemious, ſhe may uſe water wherein Cinnamon is boyled: But ſhe may not feed on ſweet meats, ſharp, and windy; ſhe muſt alſo avoid fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, thirſt, watching, mourning, ſadneſſe, anger, and all other perturbations of the mind.</p>
                        <p>Her familiar freinds muſt preſent no unwholſome thing to her, nor ſo much as name it, leaſt ſhe ſhould deſire it, and not be able to get it, and ſo miniſter her an occaſion of abort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or the Child carry with it ſome foule impreſſions. But if ſhe deſire chalk, clay, or coales, let beanes boyled with ſugar be given unto her: or if ſhe cannot get her long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, let her preſently drink a large draught of pure cold water.</p>

                        <p>FRom that time forward none of the before mentioned remedies is wont, or ought from thence to be uſed, becauſe the Babe being now become greater, ſtandeth in need of greater nouriſhment and bloud, and alſo can bear no commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of phyſick.</p>
                        <p>Although ſometimes I have met with women, which have ſo much abounded with bloud, that unleſſe they had been let bloud in the ſecond moneth, they would have aborted in the third; others again, unleſſe they ſhould attempt the ſame in the ſeventh or eight moneth, they could not carry their great belly ſo long, or elſe would be delivered of a dead iſſue.</p>
                        <p>But ſince theſe things happen but to few, they may not be granted to all, but we muſt provide for every one according to their nature and conſtitution.</p>
                        <p>And this is to be prohibited to all which are with child, that they give not way to take any bloud from the ancle bone of the foot, during the whole time of the womans going, but in ſtead thereof, if the diſeaſe ſo require, an ounce of <hi>Manna</hi> in the broth of a Cock, or ſo much <hi>Caſſiafiſtula,</hi>

                        <p>But if the belly be bound onely without any apparent diſeaſe, the broth of a Chicken, or of Veal ſodden, with Oil, or with the decoction of Mallowes, or marſh-Mallowes, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, and Linſeed; put up in a gliſter by the lower parts will not be amiſſe, yet in a leſſer meaſure then is wont to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in other Children, to wit, of the decoction five ounces, of common Oil three ounces, of Sugar two ounces, of <hi>Caſſia fiſtula</hi> one ounce. But ſharper Purgations, as alſo Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitories made of Honey and Salt, are altogether hurtfull to great bellyed women, or ſuch as lie in childbed. But of fat Pork, which they call Lard, or the yolks of Eggs without ſalt, Purgations and Glyſters are commended. But if ſhe will not take a Glyſter, either for modeſty or otherwiſe, becauſe ſhe was not accuſtomed to take it, one or two yolks of new laid Eggs, or a few Peaſe pottage warm, with a little ſalt and ſugar, ſupped up a little before meat, will be very conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient.</p>
                        <p>But if the belly ſhall be ſometimes diſtended and ſtretched out with wind, a little Fennelſeed and Anniſeeds reduced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to powder, and mingled with Honey or with Sugar, made af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of an Electuary will doe very well.</p>

And becauſe then women with child, by reaſon of the ſharp humours alter the belly, are accuſtomed to weaken both their ſpirits and ſtrength; they may well take
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:170973:8"/> before meat an Electuary of <hi>Diarrhodon,</hi> or <hi>Aromaticum Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatum,</hi> or <hi>Diamargariton,</hi> in the morning before meat, and ſometimes they may lick a little Honey; even as they which loath and nauſeate their meat, may take green Ginger con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited with Sugar, or the rindes of Citrons and Oranges condited; as alſo it is uſuall ſometimes to take ſpecificall Sirrups. Moreover, let the woman with child often uſe Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for the ſtrengthning of the Infant.

                        <p>But ſhe ſhall ſit fitly over againſt the woman in labour, and ſhall diligently obſerve on what part the birth moveth it ſelf; for if it come the right way, ſhe ſhall annoint and cheriſh the ſecret parts with odoriferous Oils; and if it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineth to the ſides, ſhe ſhall with both hands govern and diſpoſe the belly, that it may fall to the mouth of the womb.</p>
                        <p>And if the hand or feet ſhew it ſelf firſt, the Midwife, with a ſoft and gentle hand, moiſtened with broth of Fenugreek and Linſeed, ſhall gently reduce it into the place.</p>
                        <p>Certain women have the mouth of their womb ſo ſtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that without great help, ſcarce or never they can part with the child. And that cometh to paſs by reaſon of divers cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; for either ſome ſtrong heat coming from the natural parts, doth two much ſtreighten the inward parts, or the Creature is to big, or the child-bearing woman is to groſſe and fat, or the child is dead, who cannot by motion be furthering and helping to nature, or elſe cold for the moſt part in the winter, eſpecially in young ones, who have a narrow paſſage of the womb, doth more a ſtringe and bind it up; or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times heat in ſome is ſo diſſolved, that their ſtrength faileth them in the birth.</p>
                        <p>Therefore when there appeareth difficulty in bringing forth the Child, Jeſus Chriſt, the onely preſerver and ſaver in danger, is heartily to be called upon, that with his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious favour he would be pleaſed to be Aſſiſtant to the wretched party in travell.</p>

                        <p>She muſt not ſleep much, or be given to ſleep, for that maketh the Milk flegmatick; ſhe likewiſe ought not to watch more than is meet, for from hence the Milk cometh to be more hot, ſharp, and diſtaſtfull to the Infant; ſhe ought moderately to excrciſe her ſelfe, eſpecially her armes, to wit, either in ſowing, ſpinning, or knitting, for by this meanes evill humours are conſumed, as by eaſe and ſloth they are augmented.</p>
                        <p>Alſo copulation of the Nurſe exceedingly offendeth, and hurteth the Child, as that which cheifly retracteth and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſheth the Milk, and maketh it of an unſavory taſte, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting hot, and rank, or goatiſh, which bringeth no ſmall inconvenience, and hurt to the Child.

                        <p>And it is not of little concernment, in what ſwadling clothes children are wrapped; for when they are not tied up at all, or the clouts are too looſe, they are ſubject to Fluxes, Impoſthumes, apt to be crooked backt, and other diſcommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities; but eſpecially when their knees are too ſtrictly tied and bound up, and their thighs left at liberty, they are la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
                        <p>When they cry, or feel pain, or will ſleep, they are to be pacified, either by ſhewing the breaſt, or by ſinging, or by rocking, either in Cradles, or hanging Beds, or by carrying up and down. But we muſt obſerve, that children may lie ſtrait whenſoever they lie down, and ought not to be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered too much, or hot with coverings, nor yet with too few, leaſt they may catch cold. Moreover, let the linnen cloth, wherein they are wrapped, be neat and clean, for children are offended, and infected by foul and filthy excrements.</p>
                        <p>From three years of age till the ſeventh, they are to be educated gently and kindly, not to be ſeverely reprehended, chidden, or beaten, for by that meanes they be made through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their whole life after too timorous, or too much terrified, aſtoniſhed, and ſotted.</p>
                        <p>Being yet in their firſt years, they are not to be compelled to going, for ſeeing all their bones are ſoft as Wax, and the body fall the heavier, they either become lame, or univerſally reſolved in their feet.</p>
                        <p>Food muſt be daily given them thrice a day, till they are
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:170973:16"/> three years old; for if they be much filled, they are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and accuſtomed to be troubled with Convulſions, and other diſeaſes.</p>
                        <p>In the ſixth or ſeventh year of their age, they are to be ſent to ſchoole, and committed to the breeding and inſtruction of courteous and temperate Schoolmaſters, who may not ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie them.</p>
                        <p>Before theſe yeares they are not to be compelled or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to harder labours; otherwiſe they will not thrive well, but ſtand at a ſtay, and keep little, or become Dwarfes.</p>

                        <p>THere are divers cauſes whereof this diſeaſe may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, as ſundry Writers doe alledge, as by over great and unnaturall heat and drought, by great rain and inundations of waters, or by great ſtore of rotten and ſtinking bodies,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:170973:46"/> both of men and beaſts, lying upon the face of the earth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buried, as in the time of warres hath been ſeen, which doth ſo corrupt the air, as that thereby our Corn, Fruits, Hearbs, and Waters, which we daily uſe for our food and ſuſtenance, are infected: alſo it may come by ſome ſtinking dunghils, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and ſtanding pooles of water, and unſavory ſmels, which are near the places where we dwell, or by thruſting a great company of people into a cloſe, narrow, or ſtreight room, as moſt commonly we ſee in Ships, common Gaoles, and in narrow and cloſe lanes and ſtreets, where many people doe dwell together, and the places not orderly kept clean and ſweet. But moſt commonly, in this our time, it is diſperſed amongſt us, by accompanying our ſelves with ſuch as either have, or lately have had the diſeaſe themſelves, or at leaſt have been converſant with ſuch as have been infected there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with: But for the moſt part it doth come by receiving into our cuſtody ſome clothes, or ſuch like things, that have been uſed about ſome infected body, wherein the infection may lie hidden a long time, as hath been too too often experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, with repentance too late in many places, It may alſo come by Dogs, Cats, Pigs, and Weaſels, which are prone and apt to receive and carry the infection from place to place. But howſoever it doth come, let us aſſure our ſelves, that it is a juſt puniſhment of God, laid upon us for our manifold ſins and tranſgreſſions againſt his divine Majeſty: for as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith, <hi>Quicquid patimur ab alto venit,</hi> What croſſes or afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſoever we ſuffer, it cometh from the Lord, either for a triall of our faith, or a puniſhment for our ſins. Wherefore to diſtinguiſh any farther thereof I think it needleſſe, for my intent is in brief ſort, ſo exactly as I can, to ſhew the meanes how to prevent the ſame, as alſo how to cure it when we are infected. But before I enter to treat thereof, I think it not amiſſe, to ſhew what forewarnings and tokens are given us before hand of the coming thereof, thereby the better to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the ſame by prayer and repentance.</p>

                           <hi>AVicen,</hi> a noble Phyſitian ſaith, that when wee ſee the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall courſe of the ayre, and ſeaſons of the year to be alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as when the ſpring time is cold, clowdy, and dry, the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt time ſtormy, and tempeſtuous, the mornings and evenings to be very cold, and at noon extream hot, theſe do foreſhew the Plague to come. Alſo when we ſee fiery impreſſions in the firmament, eſpecially in the end of ſummer, as comets and ſuch like, and that in the begining of harveſt we ſee great ſtore of little frogs, red toades, and myſe on the earth aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding extraordinarily: or when in ſummer we ſee great ſtore of toades creeping on the earth having long tailes, of an aſhy color on their backs, and their bellies ſpotted and of divers co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and when we ſee great ſtore of gnats ſwiming on the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or flying in great companies together, or when our trees and hearbs do abound with Caterpillars, Spiders, Moaths <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which devoure the leaves on the trees and hearbs on the earth, it ſheweth the ayre to be corrupt, and the Plague ſhortly after to follow. Alſo by the beaſts of the field we may perceive it (eſpecially ſheep) which will go mourning with their heads hanging down towards the ground, and divers of them dying without any manifeſt cauſe known unto us. Alſo when we ſee young Children flock themſelves together in companies, and then will faine ſome one of their company to be dead amongs them, and ſo will ſolemnize the buriall in a mournfull ſort, this is a token which hath been well obſerved in our age to foreſhew great mortality at hand. Alſo when we ſee rivers of water to overflow without any manifeſt cauſe, or ſuddenly vaniſh away and become dry: And when clear well-ſprings do ſuddenly become foule and troubled. Alſo when the ſmall-Pox doth generally abound both in young and old people, all theſe do foreſhew the Plague to come.</p>

                        <head type="sub">Sheweth how to prevent the Plague.</head>
                        <p>THere are three principall meanes how to prevent this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious diſeaſe: The firſt and chiefeſt is to acknowledge our manifold ſins and wickedneſs unto almighty God our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father, with a hearty repentance and amendment of our former ſins committed againſt his divine majeſtie.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond means is to fly far off from the place infected, and as <hi>Rondoletius</hi> ſaith, not over haſtily to return thither again for fear of an after-clap: which ſaying is confirmed by <hi>Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> in theſe words, <hi>Non enim morietur in bello, qui non eſt in illo:</hi> and the farther from it, the ſafer ſhall we be, yet were it a very uncharitable courſe that all which are of abillity ſhould do ſo, for then how ſhould the poor be relieved, and good orders obſerved: but for Children it were beſt to ſend them far off from the place, becauſe their bodies are moſt apt to receive the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, as alſo for that they cannot ſo continually uſe antidots and preſervatives, which by their great heat may indanger them almoſt ſo much as the diſeaſe it ſelf.</p>
                        <p>The third meanes conſiſteth chiefly in three points, which are theſe: Order, Diet, and Phyſicall helps. For the firſt you ſhall have a care that your houſes be kept clean and ſweet, not ſuffering any foule and filthy clothes or ſtinking things to remain in or about the ſame: and in ſummer ſeaſon to deck your windowes, and ſtrow your floors with ſweet and wholſom hearbs, floures, and leaves, of Mints, Balme, Penniroyall, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vender, Time, Majoram, red-Roſes, Carnations, Gelliflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and ſuch like for your windowes, your floors to be ſtrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with green Ruſhes, and Mints, Oaken and Willow leaves, Vine leaves and ſuch like: your windowes which ſtand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the North and Eaſt, do you alwaies keep open in the day time, if the ayre be clear, and that no infected and unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vory ſmell be near the ſame, as Fogs, dunghils, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and every morning before you open either your doors, or windowes, as alſo in the evening when you go to bed, cauſe a good fire to be made in your Chamber, and burn ſome odoriferous or
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:170973:47"/> ſweet perfumes in the middeſt thereof, as hereafter I will ſhew you, or in ſtead thereof ſome Juniper, Frankincenſe, Bay leaves, Roſemary, Lavender, Majoram, or ſuch like, which you muſt alwaies have dried in a readineſſe, and ſo in the fume or ſmoke thereof to breath and perfume the clothes which you are to weare.</p>

                        <p>FOr our diet as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> teacheth us, we muſt have a care not to exceed in eating and drinking but to keep a mean therein, and in any caſe to beware of ſurfeting and drunkenneſs, which are enemies both to the body and ſoule, but as we may not exceed in eating and drinking, ſo to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure great hunger and thirſt is moſt dangerous, our meat ought to be of a facile and eaſie digeſtion, partly tending to a drying qualitie; as Cocks, Capons, Hens, Pullets, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge, Pheaſants, Quailes, Pigeons, Rabbets, Kid, Veal, Mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Birds of the Mountains, and ſuch like; but Beef, Pork, Veniſon, Hare and Goats fleſh is to be refuſed, and ſo are all water fowls, as Duck, Swan, Gooſe, Widgen, Teal, and ſuch like, becauſe they are hard to digeſt, and do increaſe ill blood, and naughtie juyce in the bodie: Lambs fleſh, becauſe of his exceeding moiſture is alſo to be refuſed, Eggs in the Summer not good, but in Winter tolerable: All Fiſhes which are of a hard fleſh, whether they be of the Sea, or freſh Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are to be allowed. In freſh Rivers the Perch, Barble, Gudgeon, Loch, Cool, Trout, and Pike are good; and for Sea fiſh, the Gilthed, Turbet, Sole, Rochet, Gurnard, Lobſter, Crab, Praunes, Shrimps, Whiting, and ſuch like eaten with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:170973:53"/> There are ſome Authors which hold opinion, that Fiſh is better to be eaten then fleſh in the great fervent heat of the year, becauſe they doe make a more cold bloud in the body then fleſh; another reaſon is, becauſe they doe live under the water, they are not infected with any contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the aire, as Beaſts and birds may be, and therefore more wholſome, but in my judgement fleſh is more wholſome, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it doth breed a more pure, and fine Juyce in the body then any Fiſh whatſoever; your bread ought to be made of pure wheat, not too new, nor too old, but of one dayes ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, or two at moſt is beſt: Rie bread is to be eſchewed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his great moiſture: your drink is beſt beer or ale, not too ſtrong or new, but the ſtaler and clearer it is the better, at your meals a draught or two of Claret wine is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, but in hot weather it were good to allay it with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle water, for wine doth warm the ſtomack, help digeſtion, and comfort the heart.</p>

                           <p>All kind of Pulſe is to be refuſed, as Beans, Peaſe, and ſuch like, becauſe they increaſe winde, and make raw humours and ill juyce in the bodie.</p>

                        <head>CHAP. I.</head>
                        <p>VVHen we perceive any to be infected with this contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſeaſe, we muſt with all poſſible ſpeed ſeek all the meanes we can how to prevent the malignity thereof, whoſe property is at the firſt to aſſault the principall part, which is the heart, and therefore requires preſent help; for unleſſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be done within eight or four and twenty houres, little will it then prevail to attempt it, for by that time nature is either ſubdued, and clean overthrown, or elſe hath thruſt the ſame to the exterior parts, or otherwiſe digeſted it: yet may we not neglect at any time, to uſe all the meanes we can, in helping and furthering of nature to the uttermoſt of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, becauſe we doe oftentimes ſee nature ſo wearied, and weakened in expelling of this venemous matter, that unleſſe ſome help be added to aſſiſt and comfort her, the party, for lack thereof, dyeth, which otherwiſe might be ſaved: For I have oftentimes ſeen by diligent helping of nature, that to be effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and brought to good paſſe, which I have judged moſt deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. There are foure intentions required for the curing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; that is, by bloud-letting, Cordials, ſweat and purging: but the manner how to execute the ſame, hath bred great conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion both amongſt the old and later Writers, which here to treat of were too tedious, for unto the learned it were need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, and for the commonalty little would it availe them, therefore in breif will I ſhew you what I have obſerved touching the cure.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, if it be in a Plethorick, ſanguine, and ſtrong body, and hath pain in the head, great heat at the heart, thirſtneſſe, the pulſe ſtrong, and labouring, or beating ſtrongly, and hath great and large veines appearing; theſe ought preſently to be let bloud in that ſide where yee perceive the greif doth prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:170973:57"/> it ſelfe to come forth, and not viſibly appearing, tending to maturation: For then we may not draw bloud, but uſe all other meanes we can deviſe, in helping nature to expell it, neither may you draw bloud, if the party have a flix or lask (which is an evill ſign) in the beginning of the diſeaſe, for by that meanes you ſhall hinder nature greatly, but onely give the party Cordials; neither may you ſtop the flix in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, but if it be extream, and that it ſtay not the ſecond day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then muſt you give ſome purgation, which may leave an aſtringency behind it, as hereafter in the cure of the flix ſhall be ſhewed. For as <hi>Hyppocrates,</hi> in his firſt book and one and twentieth Aphoriſme, doth admoniſh us, we muſt conſider and mark, how nature doth incline her ſelf, for that will teach us what we are to doe.</p>
                        <p>Now if you perceive the botch or carbunkle to appear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath the chin about the throat, then preſently draw bloud in both veines under the tongue, and immediately after that apply a cupping glaſſe, with ſcarification in one ſide of the neck next unto the ſore, thereby to draw it from the throat, for fear leaſt ſuddenly it choke him up, and then apply Chickens rumps, or Hens rumps to the botch, the feathers being firſt pluckt away from the rump, and a grain of Salt put into the tewell, and ſo hold the bare place to the greif untill the Chicken die, which will be within half an hour, and then apply another, and ſo continue in changing them ſo long as they doe die, and laſtly apply a mollificative Cataplaſme or plaiſter to the ſame place, as in the fift Chapter following is ſhewed, which is made with <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum baſillicon,</hi> and to the botch ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the <hi>Epithemation</hi> and Cataplaſme in the ſeventh Chapter following. But if it be in the neck, he doth complain, then let him bloud in the <hi>Cephallica</hi> vein in the arm, of the ſame ſide where he complaineth.</p>
                        <p>If in the groin or flanke he doth complain, then let him bloud in the foot on the ſame ſide, and open the vein called <hi>Maleola,</hi> or <hi>Saphena,</hi> the quantity muſt be according as the age and ſtrength of the party requireth, but at moſt draw not above ſix or eight ounces: For <hi>Avicen</hi> willeth us, to preſerve bloud as the treaſure of nature.</p>
                        <pb n="25" facs="tcp:170973:57"/>
                        <p> But in a weak, ſpare, and cachochimious body (as <hi>Galen</hi> teacheth us) we may not draw bloud at all, for thereby ſhould you greatly indanger the Patient, but help ſuch by Cordials and ſweat.</p>
                        <p>And here you ſhall underſtand, that unleſſe Phlebotomy be done at the firſt, that is, within ſix or eight houres at moſt, it will be too late to attempt it, neither may you doe it if the ſore doe appear up in height tending to ſuppuration, for then ſhould you hinder nature, which like a diligent workman, hath diſcharged and thruſt forth that venomous matter, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe would have killed us.</p>
                        <p>And here touching Phlebotomy or bloud-letting, you muſt have this ſpeciall care, that you draw not bloud on the oppoſite ſide, as if it be on the left ſide the ſore appear, then draw not bloud on the right ſide; if it appear in the flanke, then draw not bloud in the arme, but in the foot, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe you ſhall draw that venomous matter from the ignoble unto the noble parts, and ſo kill the body.</p>
                        <p>And although the party complain not more in the one ſide then the other, yet by the pulſe ſhall you perceive on which ſide the venome lieth hidden, for on that ſide where nature is oppreſt, there ſhall you find the pulſe more weak, feeble, and uneven, greatly differing from the other ſide.</p>
                        <p>And here you ſhall underſtand, that in ſome it hath been ſeen, that nature of it ſelf at the firſt, hath thruſt out that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomous matter in ſome place of the body, with a botch ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing high, and tending to ſuppuration, or a carbunckle, or ſpots called purples. Now here if you draw bloud, you doe then greatly indanger the body; but in this caſe you muſt one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give Cordials, and uſe all the meanes you can to bring it outward, either by maturation, or evaporation, as hereafter ſhall be ſhewed you.</p>
                        <p>And here you ſhall further underſtand, that where the age, conſtitution, nor ſtrength of the party will permit that Phle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>botomy be done, yet for the better help of nature you muſt apply Ventoſes, with reaſonable deep ſcarification, unto the next place adjoyning, where the party complaineth, thereby the more ſpeedily to draw the venomous matter unto the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficiall
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:170973:58"/> parts, and there to apply the rumps of Chickens, as before is taught you, and ſo apply to the place ſome ſtrong maturative, and attractive plaiſter, or Cataplaſme, as hereafter ſhall be ſhewed you. If the greif be in the head or throte, then apply Ventoſes to the neck: If it be in the emunctuaries of the heart, then apply them to the ſhoulders: If in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munctuaries of the liver, then apply them to the buttocks or thighs, now when this is done, either by Phlebetomy, or Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toſes, then within an hour or two at the moſt after it, you muſt give the ſick ſome good Cordiall Medicine, which hath power to comfort the heart, reſiſt the venomous matter, and alſo procure ſweat, whereof out of the following you may make choice as you liſt.</p>

                           <head>The cauſe of the Pox and Meaſels.</head>
                           <p>The primitive cauſe as <hi>Valetius</hi> ſaith, is by alteration of the aire, in drawing ſome putrified and corrupt quality unto it, which doth cauſe an ebullition of our bloud.</p>
                           <p>The cauſe antecedent is repletion of meats, which do eaſily corrupt in the ſtomack, as when we eat milk and fiſh toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at one time, or by neglecting to draw bloud, in ſuch as have accuſtomed to doe it every year, whereby the bloud doth abound.</p>
                           <p>The conjunct cauſe is the menſtruall bloud, which from the beginning in our mothers wombs wee received, the which mixing it ſelf with the reſt of our bloud, doth cauſe an Ebul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition of the whole.</p>
                           <p>The efficient cauſe is, nature or naturall heat, which by that menſtruall matter mixing it ſelf with the reſt of our bloud, doth cauſe a continuall vexing and diſquieting thereof, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by an unnaturall heat is increaſed in all the body, cauſing an Ebullition of bloud, by the which this filthy menſtrual mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:170973:71"/> is ſeperated from our natural bloud, and the nature being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended and overwhelmed therewith, doth thruſt it to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward pores of the skin as the excrements of bloud, which mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter if it be hot and ſlimie, then it produceth the Pox, but if dry and ſubtil, then the Meaſels or Males. But <hi>Mercurialis</hi> an excellent writer in Phyſick, in his firſt Book, <hi>de morbis puero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, cap.</hi> 2. agreeing with <hi>Fernelius</hi> in his Book <hi>De abditis rerum cauſis, c.</hi> 12. doth hold opinion, that the immediate cauſe of this diſeaſe doth not proceed of menſtrual bloud, but of ſome ſecret and unknown corruption, or defiled quality of the aire, cauſing an Ebullition of bloud, which is alſo verified by <hi>Valetius,</hi> and now doth reckon it to be one of the hereditable diſeaſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe few or none doe eſcape it, but that either in their youth, ripe age, or old age, they are infected therewith. The contention hereabout is great, and mighty reaſons are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned on both ſides, therefore I will leave the judgement thereof unto the better learned to define; but mine opinion is, That now it proceedeth of the Excrements of all the four humours in our bodies, which ſtriving with the pureſt, doth cauſe a ſupernatural heat and ebullition of our bloud, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies beginning with a Fever in the moſt part, and may well be reckoned in the number of thoſe diſeaſes which are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Epidemia:</hi> as <hi>Fracaſtorius</hi> in his firſt Book, <hi>De morbis contag. cap.</hi> 13. witneſſeth this diſeaſe is very contagious and infectious, as experience teacheth us: There are two ſpeciall cauſes why this diſeaſe is infectious: The firſt is, be cauſe it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth by ebullition of bloud, whoſe vapour being entred into another bodie, doth ſoon defile and infect the ſame, the ſecond reaſon is, becauſe it is a diſeaſe hereditable; for we ſee when one is infected therewith, that ſo many as come neer him, (eſpecially thoſe which are allyed in the ſame bloud) doe aſſuredly for the moſt part, receive the infection alſo.</p>

                     <p>THe poyſonous vapours of <hi>Arſenick</hi> being ſucked or drawn into the body, when they find no contrary poyſon with whom to wreſtle with, as with an enemy, (for in an infected body there cannot be health; but we ſuppoſe him to be well, whom we deſire to preſerve ſo) thoſe vapours muſt needs imprint a malignant and venomous quality on the ſpirit and heart, moſt adverſe and pernitious to nature.</p>
                     <p>And by <hi>Galens</hi> own doctrine, all Alexiteries doe in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, if they be uſed too liberally, greatly offend and weaken our bodies; how can we then think, that ranke Poyſons and Dilaetories, (ſuch us <hi>Arſenick</hi> is) being applied, as to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate into the nobleſt region of all other, will no whit violate and waſt our naturall, vitall, and radicall heat? <hi>Galen libr. de ſimp. cap.</hi> 18.</p>
                     <p>Nor did <hi>Galen,</hi> or any of the antient Fathers and Profeſſors of Phyſick, uſe to preſerve from the Plague, or any other poiſon, by adminiſtring ſome other poiſon inwardly, of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:170973:79"/> preſcribing outwardly Applications, but proceeded by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidotes, and Alexiteries, as will appear in <hi>libr, de Theriaca ad Piſ. cap,</hi> 16. Wherefore, unleſſe we will utterly diſclaim or relinguiſh the method and preſcripts of theſe worthy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, and proſecute new wayes and inventions, to oppoſe this man-yelling Monſter, we muſt attempt it not with Poyſons but Antidotes. And <hi>Galen</hi> defineth thoſe to be Poyſons, which agree not with nature, either well or ill affected at any time; for though there are ſome Poyſons, which if they meet in the body with a contrary venome, ſo fight with it, and oppoſe it, that both doe periſh in the conflict betwixt them; ſo that the party, by their colluctation and ſtrugling together, eſcapes with his life: yet all of them agree in uniform opinion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that where they meet with no oppoſition, they ruine the party: And therefore conclude, that <hi>Arſenick,</hi> worn by a healthy man, finding not onely no contrary Poyſon to make conflict with, but no Poyſon at all, muſt neceſſarily thwart, and oppoſe, and make an onſet on nature her ſelf.</p>
                     <p>And to confirme their opinions, I have purpoſely intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the judgements of other learned Phiſitians concurring with them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Garardus Columbus,</hi> a learned Phiſitian, reporteth, that it hath been obſerved, that the wearers of theſe Amulets, upon unuſuall heating their bodies, have fallen into ſudden <hi>Lipothi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> and Swounings, with other fearfull accidents, which continued upon them till the Amulets or Placents were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from them; and that others, though not inſtantly, yet after ſome time, have by late and wofull experience diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered their malignity, by falling into malignant and peſtilent Fevers, ſome of them ending with death.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Franc. Alphanus,</hi> a Phiſitian of <hi>Salerne,</hi> relateth of one, who wearing <hi>Arſenick,</hi> and heating himſelf with playing earneſtly at Tenniſe, fell down ſuddenly dead.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mattheus Heſſus</hi> alſo thus writeth, As Cordiall Bags or Amulets ought not to be diſavowed, ſo empoyſoned Amulets can be no way commended; nor doe I remember, that ever any received good from them, who abſtained from other
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:170973:80"/> Antidotes: But this I certainly know, that divers perſons, who carry about them Quick-ſilver in a Nutſhell, by the vain perſwaſions of ſome Impoſters, have died of the Plague, and the counſellours and adviſers of ſuch like Amulets, have been the firſt have betaken themſelves to their heeles, confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding more in their running than cunning: and yet theſe Quacks perſwaded the ignorant people, with glorious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and proteſtations, that whoſoever carried Quick-ſilver or <hi>Arſenick</hi> about his neck, ſhould be as ſafe, as if he had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed a protection from the King of Heaven</p>
                     <p>Hiſtorians alſo report, that <hi>Caracalla,</hi> though he were a wicked Emperour, prohibited by publick Edict or Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, that no man ſhould wear about him ſuperſtitious Amulets.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> the great (not without cauſe) eſteemed <hi>Pericles</hi> to have a crazed brain, becauſe he ſaw him wear an Amulet about his neck.</p>
                     <p>And hereunto Doctor <hi>Francis Herring,</hi> an able Phiſitian, as a Corollary to what hath before been written, addeth the experience of ſome <hi>London</hi> Phiſitians, who report, they have ſeen foul holes made in the breaſts of thoſe that have worn thoſe Amulets, and have obſerved divers to die, who have religiouſly worn them about their necks, as well as others.</p>
                     <p>And whereas the venters and ſetters out of theſe deceitfull wares, make them as a ſcout, to diſcover the infection when it beginneth to ſeize on a man, by clapping cloſe to the heart, to guard that principall part, as the cheif Tower: It is a meer deceit and colluſion: for whenſoever the body is heated, this event followeth neceſſarily, though no other infection be near, but the poyſonous and venomous <hi>Arſenick</hi> it ſelf, whoſe ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is rather <hi>Joabs</hi> imbracing, or <hi>Juda</hi>'s kiſſing, than friendly preſervatives.</p>

                        <p>The ſignes which declare one infected already are many; but the ſecret token of all to know the infected of the Plague is, if there ariſe botches behind the eares, or under the arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holes, or about the ſhare; or if Carbunkles ſuddenly ariſe in any member, for when they appear, they betoken ſtrength of nature, which being ſtrong, laboureth to drive the poyſon out of the body; but if botches doe not appear, it is more dangerous, for it ſheweth, that nature is weak and feeble, and not able to expell and thruſt forth the venomous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and then you muſt have reſpect to the ſignes before rehearſed.</p>

                        <p>In a man are three principall parts (that is) the Heart, Liver, and Brains, and each of theſe hath his cleanſing place:

                        <p>For when a man hath taken infection, it preſently mingleth with the bloud, and runs to the heart, which is the cheif part of man, and the heart putteth the venome to his cleanſing place, which is the arme-holes; and that being ſtopt, putteth it to the next principall part, which is the liver, and it paſſeth it to his cleanſing place, which is the ſhare, and they being ſtopt, paſſe it to the next principall place, that is, the braines, and to their cleanſing places, which are under the eares, or under the throat, and they being ſtopped, ſuffer it not to paſſe out, and then it is moved twelve hours before it reſt in any place, and if it be not let out within the ſpace of four and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hours by bleeding, it brings a man into a peſtilentiall Ague, and cauſeth a botch in one of thoſe three places, or near un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them</p>

                        <p>If the botch appear in the ſhare, bleed in the ankle on the ſame ſide, in any caſe not in the arme, for it will draw up the matter again.</p>

                        <p>When you perceive it afflict the Patient, permit him not to lie very warm, nor upon feathers (for of what quality ſoever he bee in <hi>Spain,</hi> having this ſickneſs he is laid upon wheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraw:) Then immediatly open the Median Vein, firſt in one arm, and the next day in the other, taking a good quantity of bloud: Let him have water cold, wherein Barlie and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſe-ſeeds have been ſodden without Liquorice (for the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:170973:84"/> Phyſitians hold Liquorice to bee hurtfull unto them) ſo much as he will deſire, which will be every moment; but no other drink, nor any raw fruits: Aſſoon as the ſpots appear, give him ſome Cordiall potion: and laying him upon his belly, ſet ſix Ventoſes together on his back, between and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the ſhoulders; and ſcarifying them, draw out (if it be a body of ſtrong conſtitution) 18 ounces of bloud. After which, and that he hath ſlept, he will find eaſe within twenty four hours, and ſuch alteration in himſelf, as he will thinke he is delivered of a moſt ſtrange torment. Then give him moderately nouriſhing meats, (for he will deſire to eat much) the fourth day, give him ſome convenient Purgations. And if in the mean while he is coſtive, provoke him every day by Cliſters; and warn him to forbear 15 dayes all other drink then what is ordained: And be very carefull of his diet, for if this <hi>Taberdilla,</hi> which we call here in <hi>England</hi> Gods Tokens, come againe unto the Patient, he can hardly eſcape it. And it is no leſſe Infectious, then the uſuall Engliſh Plague.</p>
